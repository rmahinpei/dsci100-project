# DSCI 100 Project
## Predicting Work Placement Status using Academic Percentages
For students, getting a work placement is of great concern. Many students work on obtaining high academic averages so that they can be recognized by employers and ultimately secure a work placement. Seeing this cycle, we chose to take on a classification project and formed the following research question: *can we predict whether an employer will hire students based on their secondary school, high school, and undergrad degree academic percentages?* We answered this question with a classifier trained by the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm using the R programming language.
